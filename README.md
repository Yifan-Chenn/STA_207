This report discusses the impact of class size on student academic performance, in this project, first-grade mathematics scores. Using a Harvard Dataverse dataset with school-level, teacher-level, and student-level variables, the essay examines if class size reduction is a viable policy proposal compared to other determinants such as teacher quality and student background. The analysis employs multiple linear regression models with robust standard errors to account for any potential deviations from normality. The results indicate that class-size reduction, particularly for disadvantaged students, has a positive and significant impact on student achievement, which supports the evidence base for class-size reduction policies. While previous research suggests teacher quality and school inputs as additional interventions, this study finds that traditional measures of teacher effectiveness, such as experience and advanced degrees, have no discernible impact on student achievement. The findings contribute to the ongoing policy debate by assisting in providing empirical verification that reducing class size is an economically feasible way of enhancing education outcomes.
